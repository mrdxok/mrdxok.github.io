<p>I am a security consultant, working for a UK-based security consultancy. I primarily work on web application assessments and external infrastructure. When I&rsquo;m not hacking, I enjoy spending time with my little family, eating food, singing, and sleeping.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was my father, Paul, who introduced me to computers — an Amstrad is the earliest system I can remember, and that was followed by various home-built systems, cobbled together using second-hand parts. I recall making my own MS-DOS batch files, and from there it was more serious programming: Pascal (using Turbo Pascal loaded from floppy disks).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been passionate about music, and in my late teens and twenties I joined (and left) several bands — the last being Happy Felix — a pub rock covers 4-piece. I always played the bass guitar on stage, and acoustic guitar when playing for my own enjoyment. But, the first musical instrument I learnt to play was the MIDI sequencer. I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was a full version of (an early iteration of) Cakewalk Express, which came free with one of my Dad&rsquo;s PC magazines (by this point magazines came with CDs). I used to love clicking musical notes onto the stave, and gradually building up compositions.</p>
<p>Despite using computers constantly in day-to-day life, making crude games in Python, and creating basic web applications in PHP, it wasn&rsquo;t until I attended a 4-day training course in 2017, that I really found out about the security aspects of computing. Since then, I have studied the protocols of the Internet, learnt how to find security flaws, and crucially – convey those flaws and subsequent risks, to non-technical audiences, whether that be in a business, or educational context.</p>
