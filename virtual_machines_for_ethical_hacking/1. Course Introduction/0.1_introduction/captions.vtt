Hello and welcome to my training course, Virtual Machines for Ethical Hacking.

1
00:05.520 --> 00:08.380
My name is James McAlonan, but you can call me Jim.

2
00:08.730 --> 00:09.990
I will be your teacher.

3
00:10.440 --> 00:15.540
This short course is aimed at those with little to no experience in hacking.

4
00:16.530 --> 00:20.940
If you want to know how and where to get started, this course is for you.

5
00:22.090 --> 00:28.330
I will show you how to set up a two virtual machines or VMs using VirtualBox, which is a piece of

6
00:28.330 --> 00:34.720
software used for managing virtual machines and is free for you to download and use. These machines

7
00:34.720 --> 00:37.650
will run inside your existing operating system.

8
00:37.990 --> 00:43.930
And while VirtualBox does work on MacOS and Linux distributions, I'll be using Windows 10 for

9
00:43.930 --> 00:45.130
demonstration purposes.

10
00:46.380 --> 00:51.270
By the end of the course, you will have set up two virtual machines, one of which will be your hacking

11
00:51.270 --> 00:54.710
toolkit and the other will be a target for hacking into.

12
00:55.470 --> 01:00.360
While this course is aimed at beginners to hacking and virtual machines, you should already have some

13
01:00.360 --> 01:02.970
knowledge of computers and computer networks.

14
01:04.050 --> 01:11.070
In particular, you should know how a computer's CPU, RAM, storage and operating system work and how computers

15
01:11.070 --> 01:12.810
communicate over a network.

16
01:13.080 --> 01:18.510
Knowledge of the TCP/IP Protocol Suite or the Internet Protocol Suite will be beneficial.

17
01:19.350 --> 01:24.580
I will introduce you to Debian, a popular and stable Linux distribution.

18
01:25.230 --> 01:30.750
I'll introduce you to the command line and cover some fundamental concepts, including the root user, the

19
01:30.750 --> 01:33.630
sudo command and basic firewall configuration.

20
01:34.530 --> 01:38.780
You will need to download and install some software in order to complete this course.

21
01:38.970 --> 01:43.740
So please make sure that you're comfortable installing software to your system and please do check the

22
01:43.740 --> 01:45.570
system requirements before proceeding.

23
01:46.260 --> 01:50.500
All the tools and software I demonstrate are free for you to obtain and use.

24
01:51.390 --> 01:53.610
Welcome to the world of ethical hacking!
