<h2 id="video-transcript">Video Transcript</h2>
<p>Many hacking courses and learning resources will point you in the direction of Kali Linux, which is a custom ethical hacking and penetration testing, distribution or distro for short as this is a course for beginners.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to show you how to start building your own hacking tool kit from scratch using one of the most popular Linux distributions, Debian.</p>
<p>In fact, Kali Linux and many other Linux distros are based on Debian, Debian is pretty stable and will be easy for you to keep up to date.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an awesome way to get started with hacking, without overloading you with a ton of tools that you may never use. To download Debian, go to Debian dot org.</p>
<p>Click on the Network Install link underneath Getting Debian.</p>
<p>And then choose amd64, at least this will be the case for most people, if you have a modern Intel or AMD processor that is 64 bit, then this is the link you need to choose.</p>
<p>Make sure you select Save File, click, OK, whilst you&rsquo;re waiting for that to download, head over to virtualbox.org.</p>
<p>Click on the link to download the latest version.</p>
<p>And then assuming you&rsquo;re using Windows, click on Windows hosts.</p>
<p>Again, save the file.</p>
<p>When VirtualBox has finished downloading, you can install it by double clicking on the executable file in your downloads folder.</p>
<p>Click next.</p>
<p>Click next again.</p>
<p>And again.</p>
<p>Take note of what it says here.</p>
<p>And then click, yes.</p>
<p>Yes, here.</p>
<p>And if you want to start VirtualBox right away, you can do. Click finish. In the next video I&rsquo;ll show you how to create your first virtual machine (VM). Once that VM is up and running, I&rsquo;ll show you how to install Debian to it.</p>
