    <h1 class="title"> Lesson 1.2: Enabling Virtualisation </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Your computer must have virtualization enabled for virtual machines to run on it. You can only enable virtualization by making changes to your system&rsquo;s UEFI, also known as BIOS, settings.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve already done that, you can skip this lecture.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re not sure what I&rsquo;m talking about right now, you need to keep watching. You&rsquo;ll need to restart your computer, then keep an eye out for which key you need to press to interrupt the normal startup process.</p>
<p>A message will appear somewhere on your screen. On this HP laptop, it&rsquo;s down there in the bottom left. On my Lenovo laptop, I would press enter.</p>
<p>But on this laptop, I need to press escape. You really don&rsquo;t get much warning and you may miss the opportunity the first time around, try again. I&rsquo;m holding the escape key down now before that message even appears.</p>
<p>Now, your menu will probably look different to this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the option to enter the BIOS or UEFI.</li>
<li>You will then need to find the virtualization setting. On my Lenovo laptop,</li>
<li>I know that setting is found under security, but on this HP laptop, it&rsquo;s under system configuration.</li>
<li>The name of the setting varies.</li>
<li>Here, it&rsquo;s called virtualization technology.</li>
<li>But it could be called VT-x, AMD-v or Intel virtualization technology, to give you a few examples.</li>
<li>Locate the setting and enable it.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may see two settings relating to virtualization.If that&rsquo;s the case, then just try enabling the first one. And later on, if you want, you can come back and enable the second one, if VirtualBox isn&rsquo;t working. Once you have enabled virtualization, you can quit, but make sure you save your settings.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not absolutely sure what you&rsquo;re doing, don&rsquo;t make any other changes here just in case you stop your computer from starting up normally. When you exit, your system will reboot and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
